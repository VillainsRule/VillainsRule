This is the confirmation that I want my entire GitHub account "VillainsRule" in its entirety removed from the Wayback Machine.

This commit is authored by my official account and committed on 12/4/25.

This has been added to the repository `VillainsRule/VillainsRule` (the README level repository). 

I, VillainsRule, have authored this commit and this file in full and wish I am removed from the Wayback Machine.
